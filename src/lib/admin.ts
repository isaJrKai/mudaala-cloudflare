// Mudaala - admin gate for deployment-level settings.
// Most settings belong to each shop; a few (like the PostgreSQL deployment
// connection) belong to the DEPLOYMENT as a whole. Those are gated to a small
// explicit allowlist: ADMIN_PHONES, a comma-separated list of phone numbers in
// any accepted dial format ("+256712000001", "0712000001"). Everyone else -
// signed in or not - gets 403.

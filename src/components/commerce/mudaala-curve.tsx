// The Mudaala curve - the brand's sweeping edge, the one shape that belongs to
// no template. It appears ONLY on doorway surfaces and NEVER on functional
// ones (cards, forms, lists, chips, buttons stay rectangles - a signature
// that shows up everywhere is just decoration again):
//
//   1. The browse front-door ribbon (the poster move - green band that rises
//      out of the page through the curve on top and flows back in below)
//   2. The shop cover-photo seam
//   3. The lettermark signboard (no-photo shop)
//   4. The printed QR poster - the brand's physical surface
//
// One path, one direction, everywhere: the edge sits low on the left and
// sweeps up to the right. Filled with currentColor, so the same path works
// over any background - text-primary where the green mass carries the edge,
// text-card / text-background where the page eats into it. Pure paint - no
// text rides on it, nothing animates, aria-hidden everywhere.

/**
 * Mudaala - one-off migration: push existing local photos to the bucket.
 *
 * When a deployment switches from local-disk storage to S3-compatible storage
 * (STORAGE_* env), the photos that already live in public/uploads/ must follow.
 * This script:
 *   1. uploads every REAL USER photo in public/uploads/ to the bucket under
 *      photos/<name> - PLACEHOLDER RULE: the seed folder is never uploaded,
 *      and never rewritten to a bucket URL (seed rows and legacy rows still
 *      referencing /uploads/seed/ are skipped and reported),
 *   2. optionally (--rewrite) rewrites the URLs stored in the database
 *      (listing photos arrays + business profile photos) from /uploads/<name>
 *      to the bucket's public URL, so every existing listing keeps working.
 *
 *   Launch sequence: run scripts/remove-seed-data.ts BEFORE any production
 *   data copy or this migration, so fixtures are already gone.
 *
 *   STORAGE_* env must be set (the bucket the photos move to), e.g.
 *   bun scripts/migrate-uploads-to-s3.ts            # upload only
 *   bun scripts/migrate-uploads-to-s3.ts --rewrite  # upload + rewrite DB urls
